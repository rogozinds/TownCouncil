TownCouncil
===========

StudyProject

This a Unity3d project, for a short demo application of the TownCouncil game.
The main idea, is that a main hero is travelling across the map, and making some economic base
decisions, specifiyng some parameters.

Now game have only 3 stages:
1. Greetings and Introduction.
2. Picking  start strategy, by specifiyng some parameters.
3. Random event- the fire in hospital, after which the player should reconsider his strategy and somehow
solve the problem with fire.

The code in the project is not an role model, because it's a first experience and is done in a real rush.
This is not a game but rather a demo application, just to give a basic look how we suppose the game should look like.
